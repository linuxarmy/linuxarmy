title: Welcome to Ukweli
description: Ukweli is a platform that was created to raise awareness of the resourcefulness of the linux operating system and to promote the use of free open source software otherwise known as FOSS

Ukweli was born out of a conversation I had with Mick, a passionate linux user and friend of mine. We wanted to share the great benefits of using linux with as many people as we could and decided to build a website to do so.  

Ukweli is a Kiswahili word that means 'truth'. We thought this was a suitable name as it aligned well with the philosophy on which the site and concept for Ukweli is built: efficiency and collaboration.
